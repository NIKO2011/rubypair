  %h2 Our little experiment

  %p
    %a{href: "/"} Ruby Pair
    began with an idea of
    %a{href: "http://twitter.com/rubygeek"} Nola Stowe's
    while at
    %a{href: "http://lonestarrubyconf.org"} Lone Star Ruby Conf 2011.
    She told a few people about her site.  Some of them mentioned this
    %a{href: "http://twtitter.com/elight"} Evan Light
    guy who had been remote pairing with people a lot at the time.
    Nola found Evan and they immediately started pairing on the beginning of Ruby Pair.

  %p
    Since LSRC '11, Evan went kind of hog wild working on Ruby Pair -- especially while playing with
    %a{href: "http://sass-lang.com"} SASS
    and
    %a{href: "http://compass-style.org"} Compass.
    A few weeks later, Ruby Pair launched!

  %p
    And there was much rejoicing, just like
    %a{href: "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enSYlCEz5VI"} when we were forced to eat Sir Robin's minstrels
    (but that's another story...).

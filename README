This is an idea that came up during a break at a daylong session at Lone Star Ruby Conference and I quick registered the domain name. I thought it would be fun to find people who are willing to pair program in your area. So this is this start of such a project. Hopefully I can find others to help me with it and get it going (and keep me on it). 

Plan
* Page where Developers can login and make a profile, including the following:
  - twitter, linked in profiles, github
  - areas of code you like (tests, views, database, etc)
  - city, state (optional)
  - prefer in-person or online pair programming
  - link to coderwall
* Page to search/browse people similar to you
* Comment on profile (talk positively how it was to pair with that person)

Future:
* Maybe a reward system (stars? rubyies?) that people can award someone who was helpful. Maybe sponsors can offer prizes.
